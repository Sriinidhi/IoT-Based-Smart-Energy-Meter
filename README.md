# IoT-Based-Smart-Energy-Meter
This enables any home or industry owner, to verify the voltage, current, power, Amount of power consumed by home-appliances, industry-machineries Remotely from any part of the world using Internet. Owner get notified through web Application (projectfactoryserver.in) with the approved Date, Time of the readings with Logins as User-name and password.

**#Simple deep-dive**
Owner get notified through web Application (projectfactoryserver.in) with the approved Date & Time of the readings with provided Login Credentials as User-name and password. Hardware set-up is installed at home or industry. As everything now is connected to Internet, this prototype helps owner to verify billing amount altering and follow prior measures to maintain the billing amount ahead.
