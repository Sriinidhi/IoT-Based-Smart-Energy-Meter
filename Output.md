**Result Analysis**
The following messages are displayed in LCD when the load is connected and when the power supply is given. Voltage, power and amount parameters will be displayed as zero and the current parameters will garbage value as there is no load connected at the output. 
1) Below figure shows the overall circuit of IoT based energy meter

whereas per program (Annexture) written displays default values as:
Voltage (V) = 00000
Current (C) = inf/some garbage value
Power (P) = 00000
Amount (A) = 00000
